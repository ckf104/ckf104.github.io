The first thing is to flatten control flow, following profile-guided analysis will benefit this new control flow structure. The process can be divided into six steps.

1. **Identifying Basic Blocks and Edges:** 
2. **Unrolling Loops:** Loops are replicated multiple times to create a series of consecutive basic blocks. Unrolling loops exposes repetitive patterns within the loop, making it easier to predict branch outcomes.
3. **Duplicating Conditional Branches:** For example, we can duplicate a block with two predecessors to create distinct paths for each possible outcome of conditional statement.
4. **Flattening Nested Structures:** This step breaks nested loop structure into a series of sequential blocks to ensure that all possible paths in the nested structure are explicitly represented.
5.  **Creating Entry and Exit Points:** 
6. **Reconnecting the CFG:** The final step reconnects the flatten CFG and updates the edges between basic blocks to reflect the new control flow structure.

After we flatten control flow graph, we will do profile-guided analysis on it.
